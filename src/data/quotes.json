  "quote": "In my city, there are lots of opportunities for continuing professional development and networking. There are lots of interest groups at my workplace who host a myriad of different events. My workplace is also just one hub of a bigger network, which means I get to experience and connect with a wide range of people. Also, my city hosts lots of conferences, which makes attending them more accessible and affordable (i.e. no need to get approval for travel costs).",

The city must be concerned about the climate change and sustainability and thus should be capable of preserving the environment. I would love to live in a city where there are greens, lakes, eco-friendly commuting systems, less or no crimes, cheaper housing options with housing security, and what not.",

  "quote":"I think having a variety of jobs available to young people concentrated in an area with restaurants, events, green space, and diverse housing options makes a city an attractive place for young people to work. Ideally, I want to be able to walk, bike, or take short trip via public transit to work. I want options to eat out for lunch or grab drinks/apps with co-workers afterwards. I want to feel like part of a community. However, I do think that what I've said aligns more with attractive neighbourhoods rather than attractive cities to work. In terms of a city being attractive for work, I think more about the logistics - e.g. affordability, broadband accessibility, commute times, etc.",
  "quote_fr":"Cities are attractive when you can see yourself putting down roots, and not just for a certain  chapter of your life. Iâ€™d love to see all generations thriving and to know that the city is a place to call home - and not just a place to be a student temporarily and then have to leave in order to afford a home or a family."

  "quote":"An attractive city for young people to work would be a place with, of course, affordable housing, easily-accessible transit, and lots of opportunities in finding a job, regardless of their situation. I also think a strong point to attracting young people to work in a city would be to increase the options of affordable leisure. In Vancouver for example, you have to pay a lot to enter an attraction like Science World or the Aquarium. A place like Vancouver needs unique entertainment infrastructure like such BUT at an affordable price to attract young people(s) to the city.",
